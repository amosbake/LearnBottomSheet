  <string name="ipsum">show\nOnce you have added a view container and properly set it up within your layout file, you can open the Activity or Fragment that uses the bottom sheet. In the sample project, this is MainActivity.java.

    For your bottom sheet to be displayable, you need to create a BottomSheetBehavior. This is created by getting a reference to the container view and calling BottomSheetBehavior.from() on that container. For this sample, you also reference the three buttons from the layout and call setOnClickListener() on them.</string>
